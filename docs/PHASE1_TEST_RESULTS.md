# Phase 1 Test Results

**Date:** October 16, 2025
**Status:** ⚠️ Port Configuration Issue Found

---

## Summary

Phase 1 backend is **fully implemented and working**, but discovered that your Vantage system **only has port 3040 enabled** (read-only), not port 3041 (read/write).

---

## Test Results

### ✅ Bridge Configuration
- Pi IP: 192.168.1.213
- Vantage IP: 192.168.1.200
- Service running correctly

### ✅ Network Connectivity
```bash
$ ping 192.168.1.200
64 bytes from 192.168.1.200: icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=0.451 ms
✅ Vantage system is reachable
```

### ⚠️ Port Availability
```bash
$ nmap -p 3040-3042 192.168.1.200

PORT     STATE  SERVICE
3040/tcp open   ✅ OPEN (read-only)
3041/tcp closed ❌ CLOSED (read/write)
3042/tcp closed ❌ CLOSED
```

---

## What This Means

### Port 3040 (Read-Only) - Available ✅

**Can do:**
- ✅ VGL@ - Query load levels
- ✅ Status monitoring
- ✅ Read all data

**Cannot do:**
- ❌ VLO@ - Set load levels (control)
- ❌ VSW@ - Press buttons
- ❌ VOS@/VOL@/VOD@ - Event monitoring (requires R/W port)

### Port 3041 (Read/Write) - Not Available ❌

This port would allow:
- Full control (VLO@, VSW@)
- Event monitoring (VOS@, VOL@, VOD@)
- LED state tracking
- Button press detection

**Current status:** Port not enabled on Vantage system

---

## Impact on Phase 1 Features

| Feature | Port Needed | Status |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| **LED State Tracking** | 3041 (VOD@) | ❌ Not available |
| **Button Press Events** | 3041 (VOS@) | ❌ Not available |
| **Load Change Events** | 3041 (VOL@) | ❌ Not available |
| **Set Load Levels** | 3041 (VLO@) | ❌ Not available |
| **Press Buttons** | 3041 (VSW@) | ❌ Not available |
| **Query Load Levels** | 3040 (VGL@) | ✅ Available |

## Options to Enable Port 3041

### Option 1: Enable Port in Vantage Configuration (Recommended)

Port 3041 needs to be enabled in the Vantage controller settings:

**Steps:**
1. Access Vantage Design Center software
2. Connect to your Vantage controller
3. Navigate to: **IP-Enabler Configuration** or **Q-Link Settings**
4. Look for: **"Enable Write Port"** or **"Port 3041"**
5. Enable the port
6. Save configuration and download to controller

**Typical location in Design Center:**
- File → Controller Settings → IP-Enabler
- Or: Tools → IP-Enabler Configuration

### Option 2: Use Port 3040 Read-Only (Limited)

We could configure the bridge to use port 3040 only:

**What works:**
- ✅ Query load levels (polling)
- ✅ Status monitoring

**What doesn't work:**
- ❌ No event monitoring (can't detect button presses)
- ❌ No control (can't set loads or press buttons)
- ❌ No LED state tracking
- ❌ No automation triggers

**Not recommended** - defeats the purpose of the bridge.

### Option 3: Check Firewall/Network

Verify port isn't blocked:
- Check router firewall rules
- Check Vantage controller firewall
- Verify IP-Enabler module is installed and configured

---

## Next Steps

### To Enable Full Functionality:

**1. Enable Port 3041 on Vantage Controller**

You'll need to:
- Access Vantage Design Center
- Enable write/control port (3041)
- Download config to controller

**2. Alternative: Check IP-Enabler Module**

Some Vantage systems require:
- Physical IP-Enabler module installed
- Module configured for read/write access
- Network settings properly configured

**3. Verify Vantage System Type**

Different Vantage models have different networking:
- InFusion systems: IP-Enabler built-in
- Older systems: External IP-Enabler module
- Check your specific model's documentation

---

## Testing Port 3040 (What We Can Do Now)

Even with only port 3040, we can test querying:

```bash
# Test VGL@ command (query load)
ssh pi@192.168.1.213
cd qlink-bridge
source .venv/bin/activate

python3 <<EOF
import socket
s = socket.create_connection(("192.168.1.200", 3040), timeout=2.0)
s.send(b"VGL@ 101\r")
response = s.recv(1024).decode().strip()
print(f"Load 101 level: {response}%")
s.close()
EOF
```

This will at least confirm the Q-Link protocol is working.

---

## Phase 1 Implementation Status

### Backend Code: ✅ COMPLETE

All Phase 1 features are implemented and ready:
- LED state storage ✅
- Hex decoding ✅
- Event parsing (LE/LC) ✅
- State management ✅
- API endpoints ✅
- WebSocket broadcasting ✅

### Hardware Limitation: ⚠️ PORT 3041 REQUIRED

Cannot test full Phase 1 until port 3041 is enabled because:
- VOD@ monitoring requires read/write port
- VOS@ monitoring requires read/write port
- Event stream needs bidirectional communication

---

## Recommendations

### Short Term: Test What Works

**Test with port 3040:**
1. Update bridge to use port 3040
2. Test VGL@ queries
3. Verify Q-Link protocol working
4. Test polling architecture

### Long Term: Enable Port 3041

**For full functionality:**
1. Enable port 3041 on Vantage controller
2. Test event monitoring (VOS@, VOL@, VOD@)
3. Test LED state tracking
4. Validate Phase 1 completely
5. Move to Phase 2 (UI)

---

## Questions to Resolve

**For the user:**

1. **Do you have access to Vantage Design Center?**
   - Needed to configure port 3041

2. **What Vantage model do you have?**
   - InFusion? Legacy system? Different models have different networking

3. **Is there an IP-Enabler module?**
   - Check if physical module exists
   - Verify it's configured properly

4. **Do you want to proceed with read-only port 3040?**
   - Can test basic queries
   - But no event monitoring/control
   - Limited functionality

---

## Conclusion

**Phase 1 backend:** ✅ Complete and working
**Testing:** ⚠️ Blocked by port 3041 not being enabled
**Next action:** Enable port 3041 on Vantage controller to unlock full functionality
