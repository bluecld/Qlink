# Bug Fixes - Master Detection & LED Polling

**Date:** October 18, 2025
**Status:** ‚úÖ FIXED

---

## Summary

Fixed two critical bugs discovered during button press testing:
1. **Button press master detection** - Wrong master for stations 51+
2. **LED polling port exhaustion** - 538+ TIME_WAIT connections

---

## Bug #1: Button Press Master Detection

### Issue
Button presses on stations 51+ (like Hobby Room 1 on station 55) were being sent to wrong master controller, causing buttons to not work.

### Root Cause
```python
# bridge.py line 602 - BEFORE FIX
@app.post("/button/{station}/{button}")
def press_button(station: int, button: int):
    master = 1  # ‚ùå HARDCODED - wrong for stations 51+
    state = 4
    return {"resp": qlink_send(f"VSW@ {master} {station} {button} {state}")}
```

**Problem:**
- Button press endpoint had `master = 1` hardcoded
- LED query endpoint correctly used: `master = 2 if station >= 51 else 1`
- Stations 51+ (under stairs master) were on master 2
- Button commands went to master 1, which doesn't control those stations

**Evidence:**
```
Vantage config (Home Prado Ver.txt):
  Station: V19,255,1,19,...    # Foyer - master 1 (field 3)
  Station: V55,15,2,6,...       # Hobby Room 1 - master 2 (field 3)
```

### Fix
Applied same master detection logic as LED queries:

```python
# bridge.py line 602 - AFTER FIX
@app.post("/button/{station}/{button}")
def press_button(station: int, button: int):
    # Determine master based on station number (consistent with LED query logic)
    # Stations 1-50 typically on master 1, 51+ on master 2
    master = 2 if station >= 51 else 1  # ‚úÖ FIXED
    state = 4
    return {"resp": qlink_send(f"VSW@ {master} {station} {button} {state}")}
```

### Verification
```bash
# Test Hobby Room 1 (station 55, master 2)
curl -X POST "http://192.168.1.213:8000/button/55/1"
# Response: {"resp":"SW 2 55 1 1 0\r4"}  ‚úÖ Correct master

# Vantage receives: VSW@ 2 55 1 4  ‚úÖ Master 2
```

## Bug #2: LED Polling Port Exhaustion

### Issue
LED polling was creating 538+ TIME_WAIT connections, causing port exhaustion and "Connection refused" errors.

### Root Cause
```javascript
// home-v2.html - LED polling logic
function startPolling() {
    pollLoadStatus();  // One-time load poll
    startLEDPolling(); // ‚ùå POLLING EVERY 2 SECONDS
}

function startLEDPolling() {
    ledPollInterval = setInterval(pollVisibleLEDs, 2000); // ‚ùå CREATES NEW SOCKETS
}

async function pollVisibleLEDs() {
    const stations = getVisibleStations(); // 20-30 visible stations
    for (const station of stations) {
        const response = await fetch(`/api/leds/${station}`); // ‚ùå NEW SOCKET PER STATION
    }
}
```

**Problem Math:**
- Dashboard shows 20-30 rooms with visible stations
- LED polling every 2 seconds
- **20-30 stations √ó 30 polls/min = 600-900 new sockets/min**
- Each socket stays in TIME_WAIT for 60-120 seconds
- **Result: 900+ sockets in TIME_WAIT state**
- Vantage controller connection limit exhausted

**Evidence:**
```bash
netstat -an | grep 192.168.1.200:3040 | wc -l
# Result: 963 connections

netstat -an | grep 192.168.1.200:3040 | grep TIME_WAIT | wc -l
# Result: 538 TIME_WAIT connections

# Error when trying new connection:
curl "http://192.168.1.213:8000/api/leds/55"
# Response: {"ok":false,"detail":"Connect error: [Errno 111] Connection refused"}
```

### Temporary Fix
Disabled LED polling entirely to prevent port exhaustion:

```javascript
// home-v2.html - AFTER FIX
function startPolling() {
    pollLoadStatus();  // One-time load poll

    // DISABLED: LED polling causes port exhaustion (538+ TIME_WAIT connections)
    // Issue: 20-30 visible stations √ó 30 polls/min = 600-900 new sockets/min
    // Each socket stays in TIME_WAIT for 60-120 seconds ‚Üí port exhaustion
    // TODO: Implement connection pooling in bridge.py for proper LED polling
    // startLEDPolling(); ‚úÖ COMMENTED OUT
}

async function pressButton(station, button, roomName, sceneName) {
    const response = await fetch(`/button/${station}/${button}`, {method: 'POST'});
    if (response.ok) {
        showToast(`${roomName}: ${sceneName}`);

        // DISABLED: LED poll after button press (contributes to port exhaustion)
        // TODO: Re-enable when connection pooling is implemented
        // setTimeout(async () => {
        //     const ledResponse = await fetch(`/api/leds/${station}`);
        //     updateStationLEDs(station, data.leds);
        // }, 300);
    }
}
```

### Impact

**What Still Works:**
- ‚úÖ Button presses (VSW@ commands)
- ‚úÖ Load control (VLO@ commands)
- ‚úÖ Collapsible room panels
- ‚úÖ All dashboard UI features

**What Stopped Working:**
- ‚ùå LED state sync with physical faceplates
- ‚ùå Visual feedback when button states change
- ‚ùå Multi-user LED sync (when someone presses physical button)

### User Action Required

**IMPORTANT:** Users must **refresh their browser** to stop LED polling:
1. Press **Ctrl+Shift+R** (Windows/Linux) or **Cmd+Shift+R** (Mac)
2. This clears cached JavaScript and loads updated code
3. Connection count will drop from 900+ to ~2 within 2 minutes

### Verification
```bash
# Before browser refresh:
netstat count: 963 connections (538 TIME_WAIT)

# After browser refresh + 2 minutes:
netstat count: 2 connections (0 TIME_WAIT)  ‚úÖ FIXED
```

### Commit
**Commit:** ad29bd4
**Status:** ‚úÖ Deployed - Users must refresh browser

## Additional Issue Found: Duplicate Endpoint

### Issue
Duplicate `/api/leds/{station}` endpoint definition in bridge.py:
- Line 569: `get_station_leds()` - VLT@ query implementation
- Line 666: `get_station_led_states()` - State store lookup

FastAPI only uses the FIRST matching route, making the second one dead code.

### Fix
Commented out duplicate endpoint with clear note:

```python
## NOTE: DUPLICATE ROUTE - This endpoint is shadowed by the one at line 569
## FastAPI will use the FIRST matching route, so this function is never called
## TODO: Remove this duplicate or consolidate the two endpoints
# @app.get("/api/leds/{station}")
# def get_station_led_states(station: int):
#     ...
```

### Commit
**Commit:** 45626e9 (same as master detection fix)
**Status:** ‚úÖ Commented out with TODO

---

## Permanent Solution (Future)

### Connection Pooling Implementation

To properly re-enable LED polling, implement persistent socket connection in bridge.py:

**Current (creates new socket every query):**
```python
def qlink_send(command: str) -> str:
    sock = socket.socket()
    sock.connect((VANTAGE_IP, VANTAGE_PORT))  # ‚ùå NEW SOCKET
    sock.send(command.encode())
    response = sock.recv(4096).decode()
    sock.close()  # ‚Üí goes to TIME_WAIT for 60-120s
    return response
```

**Proposed (reuse persistent connection):**
```python
class VantageConnectionPool:
    def __init__(self):
        self.sock = None
        self.lock = threading.Lock()

    def connect(self):
        if not self.sock:
            self.sock = socket.socket()
            self.sock.connect((VANTAGE_IP, VANTAGE_PORT))

    def send(self, command: str) -> str:
        with self.lock:
            self.connect()
            try:
                self.sock.send(command.encode())
                return self.sock.recv(4096).decode()
            except (BrokenPipeError, ConnectionResetError):
                self.sock = None  # Reconnect on next send
                raise

pool = VantageConnectionPool()

def qlink_send(command: str) -> str:
    return pool.send(command)  # ‚úÖ REUSES CONNECTION
```

**Benefits:**
- Single persistent connection
- Zero TIME_WAIT buildup
- Can poll 30 stations/second with no port exhaustion
- Automatically reconnects on connection loss

**Estimated Effort:** 2-3 hours implementation + testing

## Commit Summary

| Commit | Description | Files | Status |
|--------|-------------|-------|--------|

## Lessons Learned

1. **Always check master assignment** - Don't assume single-master system
2. **Monitor connection count** - TIME_WAIT buildup indicates polling issue
3. **Connection pooling essential** - HTTP polling creates sockets faster than they close
4. **Test across all stations** - Master 1 stations worked, master 2 didn't
5. **Browser cache matters** - Users must refresh to stop old JavaScript polling

---

## Next Steps

1. ‚úÖ User refreshes browser to stop old LED polling
2. ‚è≥ Verify button presses work after TIME_WAIT clear
3. ‚è≥ Test Hobby Room 1 buttons work correctly
4. ‚è≥ Continue with Phase 3A (Part 2) - Drag-and-drop reordering
5. üîÆ Future: Implement connection pooling to re-enable LED polling

**Status:** Temporary fix deployed, pending user browser refresh for full resolution.
