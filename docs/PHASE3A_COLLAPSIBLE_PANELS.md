# Phase 3A Complete - Collapsible Room Panels

**Date:** October 18, 2025
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE

---

## Summary

Implemented collapsible room panels with localStorage persistence, allowing users to collapse individual rooms to save screen space and customize their dashboard view. This addresses user feedback: "allow option to condense a room panel to make better use of dashboard."

---

## What Was Accomplished

### 1. Individual Room Collapse/Expand
- **File:** `app/static/home-v2.html`
- Click room header to collapse/expand room panel
- Smooth CSS transitions for collapse/expand animation
- Collapse icon (▼) rotates when collapsed (▶)
- Collapsed rooms show summary: "X loads, Y buttons"

### 2. LocalStorage Persistence
- Collapsed state saved to browser's localStorage
- State persists across page refreshes
- Per-room granular control
- Automatic save on any state change

### 3. Batch Operations
- "Collapse All Rooms" button - collapse all rooms at once
- "Expand All Rooms" button - expand all rooms at once
- Toast notifications for feedback
- Works alongside existing "Expand/Collapse All Floors" button

### 4. Visual Design
- Hover effect on room headers to indicate clickability
- Smooth transitions (0.3s) for professional feel
- Summary text in subtle gray color
- Maintains existing dark theme aesthetic

---

## User Interface Changes

### New Control Buttons
Added three buttons to the controls section:
```html
<button onclick="toggleAllFloors()">Expand/Collapse All Floors</button>
<button onclick="collapseAllRooms()">Collapse All Rooms</button>
<button onclick="expandAllRooms()">Expand All Rooms</button>
```

### Room Header Enhancement
Room headers now show:
- Collapse icon (▼ when expanded, ▶ when collapsed)
- Room name
- "All Off" button (click doesn't trigger collapse)

### Collapsed State Display
When collapsed, rooms show:
- Room header (clickable to expand)
- Summary line: "5 loads, 16 buttons"
- Hidden content (loads and scene buttons)

---

## Technical Implementation

### CSS Classes Added

**Room Header Interactivity:**
```css
.room-header {
    cursor: pointer;
    transition: all 0.3s;
}

.room-header:hover {
    background: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.02);
    border-radius: 8px;
}
```

**Collapse Icon:**
```css
.room-collapse-icon {
    font-size: 0.8em;
    color: #a78bfa;
    transition: transform 0.3s;
}

.room-collapse-icon.collapsed {
    transform: rotate(-90deg);
}
```

**Summary Text:**
```css
.room-summary {
    font-size: 0.85em;
    color: #94a3b8;
    margin-left: 30px;
    font-style: italic;
}
```

**Content Animation:**
```css
.room-content {
    transition: all 0.3s ease;
    max-height: 5000px;
    overflow: hidden;
}

.room-content.collapsed {
    max-height: 0;
    opacity: 0;
    margin-bottom: -20px;
}
```

### JavaScript Implementation

**State Management:**
```javascript
let roomStates = {}; // Track collapsed state for each room

function loadRoomStates() {
    const saved = localStorage.getItem('vantage_room_states');
    if (saved) {
        roomStates = JSON.parse(saved);
    }
}

function saveRoomStates() {
    localStorage.setItem('vantage_room_states', JSON.stringify(roomStates));
}
```

**Toggle Individual Room:**
```javascript
function toggleRoom(roomName, event) {
    event.stopPropagation();
    roomStates[roomName] = !roomStates[roomName];
    saveRoomStates();
    renderRooms();
}
```

**Batch Operations:**
```javascript
function collapseAllRooms() {
    configData.rooms.forEach(room => {
        if (room.loads.length > 0) {
            roomStates[room.name] = true;
        }
    });
    saveRoomStates();
    renderRooms();
    showToast('All rooms collapsed');
}

function expandAllRooms() {
    configData.rooms.forEach(room => {
        roomStates[room.name] = false;
    });
    saveRoomStates();
    renderRooms();
    showToast('All rooms expanded');
}
```

**Room Rendering:**
```javascript
function renderRoom(room) {
    const isCollapsed = roomStates[room.name] === true;

    // Count total buttons
    const totalButtons = stations.reduce((sum, st) =>
        sum + (st.buttons ? st.buttons.length : 0), 0);

    // Generate summary
    const summary = `${room.loads.length} load${room.loads.length !== 1 ? 's' : ''}, ${totalButtons} button${totalButtons !== 1 ? 's' : ''}`;

    return `
        <div class="room-card">
            <div class="room-header" onclick="toggleRoom('${roomName}', event)">
                <div class="room-name">
                    <span class="room-collapse-icon ${isCollapsed ? 'collapsed' : ''}">▼</span>
                    ${room.name}
                </div>
                <button class="room-all-off" onclick="allOff('${roomName}'); event.stopPropagation();">All Off</button>
            </div>
            ${isCollapsed ? `<div class="room-summary">${summary}</div>` : ''}

            <div class="room-content ${isCollapsed ? 'collapsed' : ''}">
                ${sceneButtons}
                <div class="loads-section">...</div>
            </div>
        </div>
    `;
}
```

## Benefits

- More rooms visible on screen at once
- Reduced scrolling required
- Better overview of entire system

### 2. Customization
- Each user can organize dashboard their way
- Preferences persist across sessions
- Quick access to frequently-used rooms
- Hide clutter from less-used rooms

### 3. Performance
- Collapsed rooms still functional (LED polling continues)
- No impact on load times
- LocalStorage is lightweight (~few KB)
- Smooth animations maintain professional feel

### 4. User Experience

## Usage Examples

### Scenario 1: Hide Rarely-Used Rooms
User has 66 rooms but only uses 10 regularly:
1. Click "Collapse All Rooms"
2. Click headers of frequently-used rooms to expand them
3. Dashboard now shows only relevant rooms
4. Preferences saved automatically

### Scenario 2: Temporary Focus
User working on specific floor:
1. Use "Jump to Floor" dropdown
2. Collapse all other floors
3. Expand rooms on target floor
4. Focus on specific area without distraction

### Scenario 3: Mobile View
User accessing dashboard on phone:
1. Collapse all rooms by default
2. Expand one room at a time as needed
3. Scroll less, faster access
4. Better mobile experience

---

## Known Limitations

1. **No Animation for Very Tall Rooms**
   - Max-height set to 5000px
   - Extremely tall rooms may clip during animation
   - Functionally works, just less smooth

2. **LocalStorage Limit**
   - Browser limit: ~5-10MB total
   - Current usage: <1KB for 66 rooms
   - Not a practical concern for this use case

3. **No Server-Side Sync**
   - State stored per-browser
   - Different devices/browsers have different states
   - Could add server-side preferences in future

---

## Future Enhancements

### Phase 3A.5 (Optional):
1. **Smart Auto-Collapse**
   - Auto-collapse rooms with no recent activity
   - Configurable time threshold (e.g., 24 hours)
   - User opt-in feature

2. **Collapse State Export/Import**
   - Export preferences to JSON file
   - Import preferences from file
   - Share configurations across devices

3. **Room Groups**
   - Collapse/expand by group (e.g., "Bedrooms")
   - Visual grouping with dividers
   - Nested collapse behavior

4. **Keyboard Shortcuts**
   - Press 'C' to collapse all
   - Press 'E' to expand all
   - Arrow keys to navigate rooms
   - Enter to toggle current room
