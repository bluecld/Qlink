# Phase 1 Complete - Multiple Faceplates & Event Types

**Date:** October 17, 2025
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE

---

## Summary

Implemented support for multiple faceplates per room with button event type detection. Dashboard now shows ALL stations for rooms with multiple keypads via tab UI.

---

## What Was Accomplished

### 1. Parser Enhancement
- **File:** `scripts/parse_complete_faceplates.py`
- Extracts ALL stations per room (not just first one)
- Parses button event types from Vantage config
- Maps event types to button behaviors (toggle/on/off/momentary)

### 2. Config Generation
- **File:** `scripts/merge_complete_config.py`
- Creates new config structure with `stations` array per room
- Includes event types and behaviors for each button
- Maintains backwards compatibility with old format

### 3. Dashboard UI
- **File:** `app/static/home-v2.html`
- Added tab UI for rooms with multiple stations
- Renders all stations with switchable views
- Preserves button event type metadata
- Fixes quote escaping bug in load names

### 4. Bug Fixes
- Fixed JavaScript quote escaping in load names (e.g., `6" Downlites`)
- Changed polling to single initial poll on page load
- Disabled continuous polling to prevent port exhaustion

---

## Results

### Before Phase 1:
- 35 rooms with button data
- 35 stations total (only first per room)
- 283 buttons
- No event type information
- No access to secondary faceplates

### After Phase 1:
- 35 rooms with button data
- **54 stations total** (all faceplates included)
- **386 buttons** (103 more buttons accessible)
- Event types parsed for all buttons
- **16 rooms** have multi-station tab UI

## Button Event Types

Parsed from Vantage configuration:

| Event Type | Behavior | Description |
|------------|----------|-------------|
| PRESET_TOGGLE | toggle | Click on, click again off |
| DIM | toggle | Dim/brighten toggle |
| TOGGLE | toggle | Generic toggle |
| PRESET_ON | on | Turn on preset, stays on |
| PRESET_OFF | off | Turn off preset/all |
| SWITCH_POINTER | momentary | Trigger another button |
| UNKNOWN | toggle | Default behavior |

---

## Configuration Structure

### New Format (stations array):
```json
{
  "name": "Foyer",
  "loads": [...],
  "stations": [
    {
      "station": 19,
      "buttons": [
        {
          "number": 1,
          "name": "Stairs",
          "event_type": "DIM",
          "behavior": "toggle",
          "loads": [],
          "event": "PRESET_TOGGLE"
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "station": 22,
      "buttons": [...]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Backwards Compatibility:
- Keeps old `station` and `buttons` fields (first station only)
- Old dashboards will continue to work
- New dashboard uses `stations` array if available

## Files Created/Modified

### Created:
- `scripts/parse_complete_faceplates.py` - Enhanced parser with event types
- `scripts/merge_complete_config.py` - Multi-station config generator
- `config/loads-v2-multi-station.json` - New config format
- `docs/FACEPLATE_ENHANCEMENTS.md` - Technical plan
- `docs/PHASE1_MULTI_STATION_COMPLETE.md` - This file

### Modified:
- `app/static/home-v2.html` - Tab UI, quote escaping, event types
- `config/loads.json` - Updated to v2 multi-station format

## Deployment

**Deployed to:** Pi at 192.168.1.213
**Dashboard URL:** http://192.168.1.213:8000/ui/
**Config verified:** ✅ 54 stations, 386 buttons

## Testing Checklist

- [x] Parse all 70 stations from Vantage config
- [x] Extract event types for all buttons
- [x] Generate multi-station config
- [x] Add tab CSS styling
- [x] Implement tab switching logic
- [x] Deploy to Pi
- [x] Verify config loaded correctly
- [ ] User test: Tab switching works
- [ ] User test: All buttons pressable
- [ ] User test: Event types correct

## Next Steps (Phase 2)

### LED Status Polling
1. Add `/api/leds/<station>` endpoint to bridge (VLT@ command)
2. Implement visible-stations-only polling (2-3 sec interval)
3. Update button highlighting based on actual LED state
4. Add tab visibility detection to pause polling
5. Monitor connection count (<10 target)

### Performance Targets
- Active connections: 5-10 (vs 468 before)
- Queries/minute: 60-100 (vs 1,320 before)
- Port exhaustion risk: LOW

---

## Known Issues

None identified during Phase 1 implementation.

---

## Notes

- Event type parsing successful for 386 buttons
- Some buttons show UNKNOWN event type (no Event: line in config)
- These default to 'toggle' behavior
- Master Bedroom has duplicate V51 entry (appears twice in Vantage config)
- Quote escaping fix resolves issues with load names containing `"`
