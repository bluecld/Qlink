## UI/UX Design Principles

1. **Progressive Disclosure**
   - Show essentials by default
   - Advanced features available but not overwhelming
   - User chooses complexity level

2. **Consistent Interactions**
   - Same gesture/click behavior across all rooms
   - Clear visual feedback for all actions
   - Undo capability where possible

3. **Performance First**
   - Smooth 60fps animations
   - Lazy loading for off-screen content
   - Optimize for low-power devices

4. **Accessibility**
   - Keyboard navigation support
   - Screen reader compatibility
   - High contrast mode
   - Focus indicators

---

## Success Metrics

- **Reduced Scrolling:** 50% less scrolling with collapsed panels
- **Faster Access:** 3-click max to any control (down from 5+)
- **User Engagement:** More frequent dashboard use
- **Mobile Usage:** 30%+ of traffic from mobile devices
- **Customization:** 80%+ users customize room order

---

## User Feedback Loop

**Questions for User:**
1. Which rooms do you access most frequently?
2. What actions do you repeat daily?
3. Do you prefer visual (icons) or text labels?
4. How often do you use mobile vs desktop?
5. What's frustrating about current UI?

---

## Next Steps

1. **Implement Phase 3A** (collapsible panels + reordering)
2. **User Testing** (get feedback on new features)
3. **Iterate** based on real-world usage
4. **Add analytics** to understand user behavior
5. **Build Phase 3B+** based on priority

---

**The goal:** Make the dashboard feel like a polished native app, not a web page.
