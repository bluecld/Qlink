## Technical Implementation

### Part 1: Collapsible Panels

**Data Storage:**
```javascript
// LocalStorage key: 'vantage_room_states'
{
  "Kitchen": true,      // collapsed
  "Living Room": false  // expanded
}
```

**CSS Classes:**
```css
.room-collapse-icon        /* Collapse indicator */
.room-collapse-icon.collapsed  /* Rotated icon when collapsed */
.room-content.collapsed    /* Hidden content */
.room-summary              /* Summary text when collapsed */
```

**Functions:**
- `loadRoomStates()` - Load saved states from localStorage on init
- `saveRoomStates()` - Save current states to localStorage
- `toggleRoom(roomName)` - Toggle individual room
- `collapseAllRooms()` - Collapse all rooms at once
- `expandAllRooms()` - Expand all rooms at once

### Part 2: Drag-and-Drop Reordering

**Data Storage:**
```javascript
// LocalStorage key: 'vantage_room_order'
{
  "1st Floor": ["Kitchen", "Living Room", "Dining Room"],
  "2nd Floor": ["Master Bedroom", "Guest Room", "Hobby Room 1"]
}
```

**HTML Attributes:**
```html
<div class="room-card"
     draggable="true"
     data-room-name="Kitchen"
     data-floor="1st Floor">
```

**CSS Classes:**
```css
.room-card              /* cursor: move */
.room-card.dragging     /* Opacity 50%, scaled, grabbing cursor */
.room-card.drag-over    /* Purple glow when valid drop target */
```

**Functions:**
- `loadRoomOrder()` - Load saved order from localStorage on init
- `saveRoomOrder()` - Save current order to localStorage
- `sortRoomsByOrder(rooms, floor)` - Sort rooms before rendering
- `setupDragAndDrop()` - Attach drag-drop event listeners to all room cards

**Drag Events:**
- `dragstart` - Add 'dragging' class, set data transfer
- `dragend` - Remove 'dragging' class, clear highlights
- `dragover` - Prevent default, add 'drag-over' class if same floor
- `dragleave` - Remove 'drag-over' class
- `drop` - Reorder DOM elements, update roomOrder, save to localStorage

**Floor Constraint:**
```javascript
// Only allow reordering within same floor
const draggedFloor = draggedElement?.dataset.floor;
const targetFloor = this.dataset.floor;

if (draggedFloor === targetFloor) {
    // Allow reordering
}
```

## User Guide

### Collapsing/Expanding Rooms

**Individual Room:**
1. Click anywhere on the room header (room name area)

## Files Modified

| File | Lines Changed | Description |
|------|---------------|-------------|
| `app/static/home-v2.html` | +145 lines | Added drag-drop, localStorage functions, CSS |

**Key Code Sections:**
- Lines 159-184: CSS for drag-drop states

## Performance Considerations

**localStorage Operations:**
- Reads: Only on page load (init)
- Writes: Only on user action (collapse/reorder)
- No polling or periodic saves
- Minimal performance impact

**DOM Manipulation:**
- Drag-drop reordering happens instantly (no re-render)
- Uses `insertBefore()` for efficient reordering
- No page flicker or content reload

**Event Listeners:**
- Attached once during `renderRooms()`
- Cleaned up automatically when page re-renders
- No memory leaks

## Known Limitations

1. **Mobile Touch:** Drag-and-drop does not work on touch devices (iPad, iPhone, Android)
   - **Workaround:** Use desktop browser, or wait for Phase 3D (mobile optimization)
   - **Future:** Implement touch-based reordering with swipe gestures

2. **Cross-Floor Reordering:** Rooms cannot be moved between different floors
   - **By Design:** Floors are organizational boundaries
   - **Future:** Could add in Phase 3C with custom groupings

3. **Multi-User Sync:** Room order is device/browser specific, not synced across devices
   - **By Design:** Each user/device can have their own layout
   - **Future:** Could add server-side user profiles in future phases

## User Feedback Integration

**Original Request:** "I like the direction the project is going"

**Priorities Addressed:**
1. ✅ Collapsible panels for better space usage
2. ✅ Drag-and-drop reordering
3. ✅ More app-like feel

**Next Steps Based on Feedback:**
- Phase 3B: Visual polish (compact view, dark/light theme, room icons)

## Comparison: Before vs After Phase 3A

| Feature | Before Phase 3A | After Phase 3A |

## Code Quality

**Best Practices:**
- ✅ Separation of concerns (data, logic, presentation)
- ✅ localStorage error handling (try/catch)
- ✅ Event delegation where appropriate
- ✅ Clear, descriptive function names
- ✅ Commented code for complex logic
- ✅ CSS transitions for smooth UX
- ✅ Data validation (floor matching, undefined filtering)

**Performance:**
- ✅ Minimal DOM manipulation
- ✅ No memory leaks
- ✅ Efficient event listeners
- ✅ Lazy loading (only on user action)

**Accessibility:**
- ⚠️ Keyboard navigation not yet implemented (future enhancement)
- ⚠️ Screen reader support could be improved (future enhancement)
