# LED Polling Strategy - Port 3040 Solution

**Date:** October 16, 2025
**Discovery:** YES! We CAN poll button LED states!

---

## Key Discovery: VLS and VLT Commands ‚úÖ

### VLS Command - Query Single LED

**Format:** `VLS <master> <station> <led>[CR]`

**Returns:**
- `0` = LED off
- `1` = LED on
- `2` = LED blinking

**Example:**
```
Command:  VLS@ 1 23 5
Response: 1          (LED 5 on station V23 is ON)
```

### VLT Command - Query ALL LEDs on a Station ‚≠ê

**Format:** `VLT <master> <station>[CR]`

**Returns:** `<onleds_hex> <blinkleds_hex>[CR]`

**Example:**
```
Command:  VLT@ 1 23
Response: 4C 20

Decoded:
- 4C hex = 01001100 binary = LEDs 3, 4, 7 are ON
- 20 hex = 00100000 binary = LED 6 is BLINKING
- All other LEDs are OFF
```

**This is PERFECT!** We can query all 8 button LEDs with a single command!

## Polling Architecture

### Strategy: Poll All Stations Periodically

Instead of event monitoring (which port 3040 doesn't support), we'll **poll LED states** every few seconds.

### Implementation Plan

#### 1. Poll All Stations on Timer

```python
import asyncio

async def poll_all_station_leds():
    """Poll LED states for all stations every 5 seconds"""
    while True:
        try:
            # Get all station IDs from loads.json
            stations = get_all_stations()  # e.g., [20, 23, 12, 2, ...]

            for station in stations:
                try:
                    # Query all LEDs for this station
                    response = qlink_send(f"VLT@ 1 {station}")
                    # Response: "4C 20\r"

                    parts = response.strip().split()
                    if len(parts) >= 2:
                        on_leds_hex = parts[0]
                        blink_leds_hex = parts[1]

                        # Decode hex to button states (use existing decode_led_hex function!)
                        button_states = decode_led_hex(on_leds_hex, blink_leds_hex)

                        # Update global state
                        update_station_leds(station, button_states)

                        # Broadcast to WebSocket clients
                        await broadcast_led_update(station, button_states)

                    await asyncio.sleep(0.1)  # Rate limit between stations

                except Exception as e:
                    logger.warning(f"Failed to poll station {station}: {e}")
                    continue

            # Wait before next poll cycle
            await asyncio.sleep(5)  # Poll every 5 seconds

        except Exception as e:
            logger.error(f"LED polling error: {e}")
            await asyncio.sleep(5)

# Start on startup
@app.on_event("startup")
async def startup_polling():
    asyncio.create_task(poll_all_station_leds())
```

#### 2. Performance Analysis

**For 71 stations:**
- 71 stations √ó VLT command
- Each command: ~50-100ms
- **Total per cycle: 3.5-7 seconds**
- **Poll interval: Every 5-10 seconds**

**Result:** LED states update every 5-10 seconds, which is acceptable for UI feedback!

## Comparison: Event Monitoring vs Polling

| Feature | Event Monitoring (Port 3041) | LED Polling (Port 3040) |
|---------|----------------------------|------------------------|
| **Availability** | ‚ùå Not available on your system | ‚úÖ Available now |
| **Latency** | <100ms (instant) | 5-10 seconds |
| **Network Load** | Very low (events only) | Moderate (constant polling) |
| **Button Presses** | Detects presses | ‚ùå Only sees LED states |
| **LED States** | Real-time | Polled every 5-10s |
| **Automation** | ‚úÖ Can trigger on press | ‚ùå Can't detect presses |

---

## What We Can Do with Polling

### ‚úÖ Supported Features

1. **Show button LED states in UI**
   - Poll all stations every 5-10 seconds
   - Update UI to show which buttons are lit
   - Show blinking states

2. **Control loads**
   - VLO@ commands work on port 3040
   - Set dimmer levels
   - Turn lights on/off

3. **Press buttons via API**
   - VSW@ commands should work
   - Simulate button presses from UI
   - After press, LED state updates on next poll

4. **Query loads**
   - VGL@ commands work
   - Poll load levels
   - Show current dimmer states

### ‚ùå Not Supported

1. **Instant LED updates**
   - 5-10 second delay
   - Not real-time

2. **Button press detection**
   - Can't detect when physical button pressed
   - Can only see LED state changes
   - **No automation triggers from physical presses**

3. **Real-time event stream**
   - No WebSocket events from Vantage
   - Can broadcast polled states, but delayed

## Implementation Steps

### Phase 1: Test VLT Command

```bash
# SSH to Pi and test VLT command
ssh pi@192.168.1.213
cd qlink-bridge
source .venv/bin/activate

# Test VLT command on station V23
python3 <<EOF
import socket
s = socket.create_connection(("192.168.1.200", 3040), timeout=2.0)
s.send(b"VLT@ 1 23\r")
response = s.recv(1024).decode().strip()
print(f"Station V23 LEDs: {response}")
s.close()
EOF
```

**Expected:** Should return something like `"4C 20"` (hex values for on/blink LEDs)

### Phase 2: Add Polling to bridge.py

**Modify event_listener_loop():**

Since port 3040 doesn't support persistent monitoring connections, replace the event listener with a polling loop:

```python
def led_polling_loop():
    """Background thread that polls LED states"""
    global button_led_states

    logger.info("üîÑ LED polling thread started (port 3040 mode)")

    while True:
        try:
            # Get all stations from loads.json
            stations = []
            try:
                with open("app/loads.json", "r") as f:
                    data = json.load(f)
                    for room in data.get("rooms", []):
                        if "station" in room:
                            stations.append(room["station"])
            except:
                pass

            if not stations:
                logger.warning("No stations configured in loads.json")
                time.sleep(10)
                continue

            logger.debug(f"Polling {len(stations)} stations...")

            for station in stations:
                try:
                    # Query all LEDs for this station
                    sock = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
                    sock.connect((VANTAGE_IP, VANTAGE_PORT))
                    sock.settimeout(2.0)

                    sock.send(f"VLT@ 1 {station}\r".encode("ascii"))
                    response = sock.recv(1024).decode("ascii").strip()
                    sock.close()

                    # Parse response: "4C 20"
                    parts = response.split()
                    if len(parts) >= 2:
                        on_hex = parts[0]
                        blink_hex = parts[1]

                        # Decode using existing function
                        button_states = decode_led_hex(on_hex, blink_hex)

                        # Update global state
                        update_station_leds(station, button_states)

                        # Create event for WebSocket broadcast
                        event = {
                            "type": "led_poll",
                            "station": station,
                            "station_id": f"V{station}",
                            "on_leds": on_hex,
                            "blink_leds": blink_hex,
                            "button_states": button_states,
                            "timestamp": datetime.now().isoformat()
                        }

                        # Broadcast to WebSocket clients
                        broadcast_event_sync(event)

                        logger.debug(f"üìä V{station}: {button_states}")

                    time.sleep(0.05)  # Rate limit between stations

                except Exception as e:
                    logger.warning(f"Failed to poll V{station}: {e}")
                    continue

            # Wait before next poll cycle
            time.sleep(5)  # Poll every 5 seconds

        except Exception as e:
            logger.error(f"Polling loop error: {e}")
            time.sleep(5)
```

### Phase 3: Update UI

The UI code from Phase 1 still works! Just update the WebSocket handler to expect polling events:

```javascript
ws.onmessage = (event) => {
    const data = JSON.parse(event.data);

    // Handle polled LED states
    if (data.type === 'led_poll' && data.button_states) {
        updateButtonLEDs(data.station, data.button_states);
    }
};
```

## Performance Estimates

### Polling 71 Stations

**Best case:** 50ms per station
- 71 √ó 50ms = 3.55 seconds per cycle
- Poll every 5 seconds
- **Update latency: 5-10 seconds**

**Worst case:** 100ms per station
- 71 √ó 100ms = 7.1 seconds per cycle
- Poll every 10 seconds
- **Update latency: 10-20 seconds**

**Recommendation:** Start with 5-second interval, adjust based on performance.

### Network Load

- 71 stations √ó 1 VLT command = 71 queries per cycle
- Every 5 seconds = 14.2 queries/second average
- Moderate network load, should be fine

## Benefits of This Approach

1. ‚úÖ **Works with port 3040** (your current setup)
2. ‚úÖ **No config changes needed** (don't touch IP-Enabler)
3. ‚úÖ **Shows button LED states** (main goal achieved!)
4. ‚úÖ **Reuses Phase 1 code** (decode_led_hex, state storage, API endpoints)
5. ‚úÖ **UI integration ready** (WebSocket broadcasts still work)

---

## Limitations

1. ‚ö†Ô∏è **5-10 second delay** for LED updates (not real-time)
2. ‚ùå **No button press detection** (can't trigger automation)
3. üìà **Higher network load** than event monitoring

---

## Next Steps

1. ‚úÖ Test VLT command on your Vantage system
2. ‚úÖ Implement polling loop in bridge.py
3. ‚úÖ Deploy to Pi
4. ‚úÖ Test LED state polling
5. ‚úÖ Move to Phase 2 (UI integration)

---

**Conclusion:** YES! We can absolutely implement LED status tracking using **VLT polling** on port 3040. It's not as fast as event monitoring, but it works with your current setup and achieves the main goal: showing button LED states in the UI!
