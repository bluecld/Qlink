**Step 2: Connect and Push**

Copy your GitHub username first, then run in PowerShell:

```powershell
cd C:\Qlink

# Replace YOUR-USERNAME with your actual GitHub username
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/vantage-qlink-bridge.git

# Rename branch to main (GitHub standard)
git branch -M main

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

You'll be prompted for GitHub username and password (use Personal Access Token as password).

## 🔐 GitHub Authentication

### If prompted for credentials:

**Username:** Your GitHub username

**Password:** Use a Personal Access Token (NOT your GitHub password!)

#### To create a token:
1. Go to: https://github.com/settings/tokens
2. Click "Generate new token (classic)"
3. Give it a name: "VS Code Access"
4. Select scopes:
   - ✅ `repo` (full control)
   - ✅ `workflow`
5. Click "Generate token"
6. **COPY IT IMMEDIATELY** (you won't see it again!)
7. Use this token as your password

→ Try logging out and in again in VS Code
