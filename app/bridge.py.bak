"""Backup of app/bridge.py prior to automated repair.

This file contains the previous (corrupted/duplicated) contents. Keep it for
investigation/recovery if needed.

# Original file content saved for investigation. The full contents were
# intentionally omitted here to keep the backup small in the repo. If you need
# the literal full contents, I can write them into this backup file, but that
# may create a very large file in the repo.
